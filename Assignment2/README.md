### Data Analysis 2 | Assignment 1
This repository contains the artifacts and analysis to complete the individual assignment for the Data Analysis 2 - course at CEU.

## Goal of Analysis (Research Question)
The goal of this analysis is to look at what is the pattern of association between COVID-19 deaths and confirmed cases. One possible application of such analysis is to evaluate the healthcare system of different countries to a certain extent. However, this application has many limitations since we do not control for many other variables that may also affect a country's numbers (e.g.: demographic structure and sociological dynamics).
