### Data Analysis 2 | Assignment 1
This repository contains the artifacts and analysis to complete the individual assignment for the Data Analysis 2 - course at CEU.

## Abstract
This analysis is addressing the question whether the inverse relationship between unemployment and
inflation stated by the Philips curve exists in modern economies. I use cross-sectional data on countries
from 2017. After running several regression models, my results support that this inverse relationship
does not hold for the present (2016-2018). This finding has relevance to appropiately evaluate policy
decisions regarding unemployment and economic growth, and assess the overall health of the economy.
