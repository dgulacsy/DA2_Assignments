The data for this project comes from World Banks Open Data using the WDI API service. The obtained economic indicators are the following:

1.  [Unemployment] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS)
2.  [Inflation] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.KD.ZG)
3.  [GDP Growth] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG)
4.  [Government Expenditure] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.GOVT.ZS)
5.  [Broad money] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FM.LBL.BMNY.GD.ZS)
6.  [Gross savings] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FM.LBL.BMNY.GD.ZS)
7.  [Population] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

# Origin of Data

Population data is gathered through annual statistical reports submitted by the countries themselfe mostly via a national statistic institution that the World Bank acknowledges.

# Data Quality

The collected data might have several flaws. One of the issues is that there are some countries that may factor in political consequence considering the numbers they report. So their numbers may be significantly lower than actuals. Secondly, reliability is also questionable. It is hard to believe that if cases were recounted they would be the same for the same observations. Most likely the data contains many errors due to duplication misshandling and so on. The third issue is comparability. Since variables are coming from highly aggregated data, the underlying processes that different statistical agencies carry out may differ from country to country.

# Data Cleaning

1. Get rid of observations that cannot considered as a country
2. Delete observations that have any missing values
3. Convert years to factors
